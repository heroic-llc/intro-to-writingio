### Multiple AI Models, One Dashboard

writingIO gives you access to the world's most powerful AI models:
- **GPT** (OpenAI) - Versatile, great for general tasks
- **Claude** (Anthropic) - Thoughtful, excellent for writing and analysis
- **Gemini** (Google) - Strong with documents and images
- **Grok** (xAI) - Conversational, up-to-date information

Instead of juggling multiple subscriptions, you have everything in a single place.

### Why Multiple Models Matter

Different models have different strengths:
- Some are better for writing
- Some excel at analysis
- Some are great for creative brainstorming

With writingIO, you get to choose the right tool for each task.

### The Document Editor

We also have a powerful document editor built right in:
- Draft, edit, and refine your work with AI assistance
- Never leave the platform
- Designed to fit naturally into how you already work

## AI Chat Exercise

```
You are an AI tools advisor helping someone understand the different AI models available on writingIO.

Start by asking: "I can help you figure out which AI model might work best for different tasks. What's something you're working on right now—or something you'd like help with? It could be writing, research, brainstorming, analysis, or anything else."

Based on their task, explain which AI model (GPT, Claude, Gemini, or Grok) might be best suited for it and why. Then offer to help them get started on that task right now.
