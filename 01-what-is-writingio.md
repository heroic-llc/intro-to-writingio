Hi and welcome to writingIO. I'm Amanda, the Chief Learning Officer at writingIO. And this video? It was made with the help of an A I tool. Pretty cool, right? It's also a great indication of just how fast and powerful A I actually is.

Our mission at writingIO is simple. We help you use artificial intelligence effectively.

We've helped over a hundred thousand individuals, including professionals and teams at organizations like Microsoft, Shopify, and even NASA, get better at working with A I through our courses and tools.

writingIO isn't just a learning platform. It's also a powerful tool that allows you to access the world's most powerful A I models and services, all in one place.

Whether you're just getting started or looking to level up, writingIO gives you everything you need. Access to the top A I models like G P T, Claude, Gemini, and Grok. Courses that teach you practical skills and responsible use. And certifications you can actually add to your resume.

The best part? You don't need to spend weeks learning. A few lessons in, you'll already feel more confident. That's the whole idea, to meet you where you are and help you move forward.

So if you've been curious about A I but weren't sure where to start, or you're already using it and want to get more out of it, you're in the right place.
